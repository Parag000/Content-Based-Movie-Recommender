# Content-Based-Movie-Recommender
This project builds a content-based movie recommendation system using the TMDB dataset. By combining metadata features like cast, genres, and directors into a "metadata soup," it calculates movie similarity with vectorizers (Count) and cosine similarity. Ideal for learning content-based filtering and text vectorization techniques.
